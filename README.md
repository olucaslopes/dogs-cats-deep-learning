## Dogs vs cats

This is a simple notebook to show how to use a pretrained model to classify images. In this case, we will use the VGG16 model to classify images of dogs and cats. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set has 25,000 images of dogs and cats. The test set has 12,500 images. The images are in different sizes and shapes. We will resize the images to 150x150 pixels.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Load the pretrained model
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Make predictions

### Summary

The model achieved an accuracy of 97.5% on the test set. The model was able to classify images of dogs and cats with high accuracy.
